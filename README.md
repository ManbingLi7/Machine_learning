# Machine Learning
- This repository contains various projects which have been solved with the help of machine learning
- This is a class that uses Optuna package to optimize the hyperparameters of MLP, XGB, CNN.
- It was created to be used in the google colab https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1I4HS7SZduw426C-YuxboArrfI9QiT6OV?usp=sharing
- The offline notebook is available at the [link](https://github.com/shahidzk1/HP_OPT/blob/main/Higgs_challenge/HiggsBosonChallenge.ipynb)
- If you want to run it on your personal computer e.g. on Visual studio then
- - Git clone 
  - Run [the notebook](https://github.com/shahidzk1/Machine_learning/blob/main/HiggsBosonChallenge_personal_PC.ipynb)
