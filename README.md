# Machine Learning
- This repository contains various projects which have been solved with the help of machine learning
- This [link](https://github.com/shahidzk1/Machine_learning/blob/main/HP_OPT_class/HP_OPT_class_code.py) has a class that uses Optuna package to optimize the hyperparameters of MLP, XGB, CNN using the TPE algorithm.

## Higgs Boson Challenge
  - The [class](https://github.com/shahidzk1/Machine_learning/blob/main/HP_OPT_class/HP_OPT_class_code.py) was created to be used for the hyperparameters optimization in the [google colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1I4HS7SZduw426C-YuxboArrfI9QiT6OV?usp=sharing)
  - The colab uses different ML algorithms for the higgs selection from the background and the data comes from the [HiggsChallenge](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/higgs-boson/data)
  - The offline notebook is available at the [link](https://github.com/shahidzk1/HP_OPT/blob/main/Higgs_challenge/HiggsBosonChallenge.ipynb)
  - If you want to run it on your personal computer e.g. on Visual studio then
    - Git clone https://github.com/shahidzk1/Machine_learning.git
    - Run [the notebook](https://github.com/shahidzk1/Machine_learning/blob/main/Higgs_challenge/HiggsBosonChallenge_personal_PC.ipynb)
